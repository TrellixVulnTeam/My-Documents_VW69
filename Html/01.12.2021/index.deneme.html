<p>
      DAY HAD <small> DAWNED </small>  <del> COLD AND GRAY </del>  WHEN the man turned aside from the main <sup> Yukon </sup>
      trail.<br />
      He climbed the high earth-bank where a little-traveled trail led east
      through the pine forest. It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe at
      the top. <mark> He excused the act to himself by looking at his watch. </mark> It was
      nine o’clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although
      there was not a cloud in the sky. <b>It was a clear day.</b> However,
      there seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. That
      was because the sun was absent from the sky. <ins> This fact did not
      <mark>  <b>worry </mark>  the </b>man. </ins> He was not alarmed by the lack of sun. It had been
      days since he had seen the sun.
    </p>
       <p>
      The man looked along the way he had come. <br />The Yukon lay a mile wide
      and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet
      of snow. It was all pure white. <strong>North</strong>  and south, as far as his eye could
      see, it was unbroken white. The one thing that relieved the whiteness was
      a thin dark line that curved from the pine-covered island to the south. It
      curved into the north, where it <em> disappeared </em>  <i> behind </i> another pine-covered
      island. This dark line was the trail—the main trail.  It led south 500
        miles <b> to the <i> Chilcoot Pass </i>  </b>  , and salt water.  It led north 75 miles to
      Dawson, and still farther on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and
      finally to <small> St. Michael, </small>  on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a
      thousand more.
    </p> -->
    <!--     <strong>
    <p>
      But all this—the distant trail, no sun in the sky, the great cold, and the
      strangeness of it all—had no effect on the man. It was not because he was
      long familiar with it. He was a newcomer in the land, and this was his
      first winter.
